When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I, like, need to share with other crew or make sure there is a level of redundancy.  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Redundancy.  Don't want to overwrite any good new work.  Also may have rolled back commits.
